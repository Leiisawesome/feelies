## Top-Level Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|

## Features

Features can be specified as a dict (keyed by feature_id) or a list of dicts with `feature_id` field.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `feature_id` | string | Yes (list form) | Unique feature identifier. |
| `computation` | string | Yes* | Inline Python defining `initial_state()` and `update(quote, state, params)`. |

*One of `computation` or `computation_module` is required.

### Computation Functions

The `computation` code (or module) must define:

- `initial_state() -> dict` — returns initial mutable state (0 required args)
- `update(quote, state, params) -> float` — returns feature value (3 required args)
- `update_trade(trade, state, params) -> float | None` — optional trade handler (3 required args)

## Signal

The `signal` code must define:

- `evaluate(features, params) -> Signal | None` — returns a Signal or None (2 required args)

Available in signal namespace: `Signal`, `SignalDirection`, `LONG`, `SHORT`, `FLAT`, `alpha_id`.

## Directory Layout

Alphas can be placed in either layout:

- **Flat:** `alphas/my_alpha.alpha.yaml`
- **Nested:** `alphas/my_alpha/my_alpha.alpha.yaml` (supports `computation_module` references)

## Schema 1.1 (Three-Layer)

> **Status: `SIGNAL` + `PORTFOLIO` accepted (Phase 3-α + Phase 3.1 + Phase 4 + Phase 4.1). `LEGACY_SIGNAL` retired (Workstream D.2). `SENSOR` reserved (Phase 5).**
>
> As of Workstream D.2, `schema_version: "1.1"` accepts:
>
> - `layer: SIGNAL` — horizon-anchored, regime-gated, optional v0.3 `trend_mechanism:` block enforced by G16 (Phase 3-α + Phase 3.1).
> - `layer: PORTFOLIO` — cross-sectional alpha consuming
>   `CrossSectionalContext` and emitting `SizedPositionIntent`. Must
>   declare `universe`, `depends_on_signals`, `factor_neutralization`,
>   and `cost_arithmetic`. Risk decomposition (per-leg veto) is
>   handled by `RiskEngine.check_sized_intent`. Optional
>   `decay_weighting_enabled: true` parameter enables
>   inverse-staleness reweighting (Phase 4.1). Optional `hazard_exit:
>   {enabled: true, ...}` block wires `HazardExitController` for
>   hazard-spike-driven exits and a hard-exit age cap (Phase 4.1).
> - `layer: LEGACY_SIGNAL` is rejected with a workstream-D.2 retirement
>   error pointing at the migration cookbook.
> - `layer: SENSOR` is still rejected with a "Phase 5 not yet
>   implemented" error.
>
> As of Phase 3.1, the v0.3 `trend_mechanism:` block is **enforced by
> gate G16** for any `SIGNAL`/`PORTFOLIO` alpha that declares one (see
> [`design_docs/three_layer_architecture.md`](../design_docs/three_layer_architecture.md)
> §20.6). Strict mode is opt-in via `enforce_trend_mechanism: true` in
> `platform.yaml`, in which case schema-1.1 `SIGNAL`/`PORTFOLIO` specs
> *missing* a `trend_mechanism:` block are also rejected. Four
> reference alphas covering the non-stress families ship in this slice
> (`pofi_hawkes_burst_v1`, `pofi_kyle_drift_v1`,
> `pofi_inventory_revert_v1`, `pofi_moc_imbalance_v1`); the
> `LIQUIDITY_STRESS` family is enforced **exit-only** — a stress-family
> alpha may not emit an entry-direction `Signal`. See §20.10 (v0.3
> Phased Delivery) for the full timeline.

### Top-level fields added in 1.1

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `schema_version` | string | Yes | Set to `"1.1"`. Schema 1.0 was hard-removed in Workstream D.1. |
| `layer` | string | Yes | Dispatch key. One of `SIGNAL`, `PORTFOLIO`, `SENSOR`. The historical value `LEGACY_SIGNAL` is rejected with a workstream-D.2 retirement error; `SENSOR` is reserved for Phase 5. |
| `horizon_seconds` | int | No (Phase 3) | Decision-horizon for `SIGNAL` and `PORTFOLIO` alphas. Must be a registered horizon (Phase 3). |
| `cost_arithmetic` | string | No (Phase 3) | Declares whether edge / cost are quoted in `bps` or `usd`. Phase-3 gate G12 will require this on all non-legacy alphas. |
| `regime_gate` | string | No (Phase 3) | DSL expression over regime posteriors (e.g. `dominant == "compression" and P("vol_breakout") < 0.2`). Evaluated at the horizon boundary. |
| `depends_on_sensors` | list[string] | No (Phase 2/3) | Sensor IDs (with version pin) consumed by this alpha. |
| `depends_on_signals` | list[string] | No (Phase 4) | Upstream `SIGNAL` alphas consumed by a `PORTFOLIO` alpha. |
| `structural_actor` | string | No (Phase 3) | Free-text description of the actor whose behavior the alpha trades against. |
| `mechanism` | string | No (Phase 3) | Free-text mechanism summary; complementary to the v0.3 `trend_mechanism` block below. |
| `trend_mechanism` | dict | No (Phase 1.1 parsed, Phase 3.1 enforced) | v0.3 mechanism descriptor, see below. |
| `hazard_exit` | dict | No (Phase 1.1 parsed, Phase 4.1 enforced) | v0.3 hazard-rate exit policy, see below. |

### `trend_mechanism:` block (v0.3, §20.5)

Optional mechanism descriptor for `SIGNAL`-layer alphas. **Opt-in via
field presence** — absent block ⇒ no enforcement. When present in
Phase 1.1, the loader checks only that `family:` belongs to the closed
taxonomy:

| `family:` value | Description |
|---|---|
| `KYLE_INFO` | Informed-trader price-impact (Kyle 1985). |
| `INVENTORY` | Market-maker inventory drift. |
| `HAWKES_SELF_EXCITE` | Self-exciting order-flow cluster. |
| `LIQUIDITY_STRESS` | Depth withdrawal / spread blow-out. |
| `SCHEDULED_FLOW` | Known time-of-day flow window. |

Adding a new family is a deliberate platform-level change (modify
`feelies.core.events.TrendMechanism` and
`feelies.alpha.loader._TREND_MECHANISM_FAMILIES` together). Per-family
parameter constraints (decay curves, regime predicates, feature
whitelists) are documented in §20.6 of the design doc and will be
enforced by gate G16 (raised as
`feelies.alpha.layer_validator.TrendMechanismValidationError`) in
Phase 3.1.

### `hazard_exit:` block (v0.3, §20.5)

Optional hazard-rate-driven exit policy for `SIGNAL`- or
`PORTFOLIO`-layer alphas. **Opt-in via field presence**. Phase 1.1
only checks that the block is a mapping; field-level enforcement is
deferred to Phase 4.1 when the composition layer activates
hazard-rate exits via `RegimeHazardSpike` events.

### Architectural gates

| Gate | Status | Description |
|---|---|---|
| G1 | **Active** (Phase 4) | Layer independence — `SIGNAL` may not import PORTFOLIO modules; `PORTFOLIO` may not bypass `RiskEngine`. Downgradable to a warning via `PlatformConfig.enforce_layer_gates: false` (research escape hatch); always blocks in strict mode. |
| G2 | **Active** (Phase 3-α) | Event typing — `signal:` code must be a string, no inline objects, no module-level side effects. |
| G3 | **Active** (Phase 4) | Strict cross-alpha isolation — a PORTFOLIO alpha's `depends_on_signals` may not reference signals at a different `horizon_seconds`. Downgradable to a warning via `PlatformConfig.enforce_layer_gates: false`; always blocks in strict mode. |
| G4 | **Active** (Phase 3-α) | Regime-gate purity — `regime_gate.on/off_condition` must parse as a whitelisted DSL expression (`RegimeGate.compile`). |
| G5 | **Active** (Phase 3-α) | Signal purity — `signal:` evaluate must not import, mutate globals, call `open`/network/clock, or read state outside `(snapshot, regime, params)`. |
| G6 | **Active** (Phase 3-α) | Feature/sensor dependency DAG — every entry in `depends_on_sensors` must resolve to a registered sensor; no unknown ids; no cycles. |
| G7 | **Active** (Phase 3-α) | Horizon registration — `horizon_seconds` must be one of the platform-registered horizons. |
| G8 | **Active** (Phase 3-α) | No implicit lookahead — AST-scan rejects access to future-bucketed names. |
| G9 | **Active** (Phase 4) | Cross-symbol staleness checks — `CrossSectionalContext.completeness` must clear the per-platform `composition_completeness_threshold` (default `0.7`) for the boundary to produce a `SizedPositionIntent`. Always blocks (data-integrity gate; not affected by `enforce_layer_gates`). |
| G10 | **Active** (Phase 4) | PORTFOLIO `universe:` presence + scale cap — every PORTFOLIO alpha must declare a non-empty `universe:` list and the universe size must be ≤ `composition_max_universe_size` (v0.2 cap = 50 symbols). Always blocks. |
| G11 | **Active** (Phase 4) | PORTFOLIO `factor_neutralization:` disclosure — every PORTFOLIO alpha must declare `factor_neutralization: true` (or list explicit excluded factor IDs). Reference factor loadings under `data/reference/factor_loadings/` must exist and not exceed `factor_loadings_max_age_seconds`; missing or stale loadings raise `StaleFactorLoadingsError` at bootstrap. Always blocks. |
| G12 | **Active** (Phase 3-α) | Cost-arithmetic disclosure — `cost_arithmetic` block required, `margin_ratio >= 1.5`, components reconcile within ±5%. |
| G13 | **Active** (Phase 3-α) | Warm-up documentation — `SIGNAL` inherits warm-up from sensor warm-up by construction; the inline-features warm-up branch is unreachable post-D.2 (the loader rejects `LEGACY_SIGNAL` before validation). |
| G14 | **Active** (Phase 1) | Alpha must declare no data dependency outside L1 NBBO + trades + reference data + session calendar. |
| G15 | **Active** (Phase 1) | Declared `fill_model.router` must name a platform-supported router (`PassiveLimitOrderRouter` or `BacktestOrderRouter`). |
| G16 | **Active** (Phase 3.1) | Mechanism-horizon binding — when a `schema_version: "1.1"` SIGNAL/PORTFOLIO alpha declares a `trend_mechanism:` block, validates: (1) `family` ∈ closed taxonomy; (2) `expected_half_life_seconds` ∈ per-family envelope; (3) `horizon_seconds / expected_half_life_seconds` ∈ `[0.5, 4.0]`; (4) every entry in `l1_signature_sensors` is a registered sensor; (5) the family's primary fingerprint sensor is among them; (6) `failure_signature` declared; (7) `LIQUIDITY_STRESS` mechanisms emit no entry-direction `Signal` (AST-checked); (8) PORTFOLIO `trend_mechanism.consumes.max_share_of_gross` summation; (9) PORTFOLIO `depends_on_signals` family whitelist. Strict mode (`platform.yaml: enforce_trend_mechanism: true`) additionally rejects schema-1.1 SIGNAL/PORTFOLIO specs missing `trend_mechanism:` entirely. |

### Phase-2 status (Sensor layer + Horizon scheduler shipped)

As of Phase 2 + Phase 2.1, the platform exposes a complete L1 sensor
catalog and horizon-aware feature scaffolding, but alpha specs are
**not yet required** to consume any of it:

- `depends_on_sensors:` is now meaningfully populated from
  `feelies.sensors.registry.SensorRegistry`. The 13 catalog sensors
  shipped in v0.3 are:
  - **P2-β simple** (4): `ofi_ewma`, `micro_price`, `spread_z_30d`,
    `realized_vol_30s`.
  - **P2-γ complex** (5): `vpin_50bucket`, `kyle_lambda_60s`,
    `quote_hazard_rate`, `quote_replenish_asymmetry`,
    `trade_through_rate`.
  - **P2.1 v0.3 mechanism fingerprints** (4): `hawkes_intensity`,
    `scheduled_flow_window`, `snr_drift_diffusion`,
    `structural_break_score`.
- `HorizonScheduler` emits `HorizonTick` events at deterministic
  event-time boundaries (`session_open_ns + k * horizon_seconds * 1e9`)
  for every horizon configured under `platform.horizons_seconds`.
  Schedulers and the registry use *isolated* sequence generators so
  Phase-2 wiring cannot perturb the locked Level-1 fill sequence
  (Inv-A / C1).
- `HorizonAggregator` runs in **passive emitter** mode in Phase 2:
  it publishes `HorizonFeatureSnapshot` events with empty
  ``values``/``warm``/``stale`` dicts so downstream consumers can be
  built and tested against a stable contract before Phase 3 wires
  concrete `HorizonFeature` implementations.
- The `scheduled_flow_window` sensor reads
  ``storage/reference/event_calendar/<date>.yaml``; the calendar's
  `EventCalendar.hash()` is folded into the bootstrap provenance
  bundle (Inv-13).

Phase-2 wiring is purely additive — enabling sensors, horizons, or
the aggregator does not affect any existing event sequence (Inv-A).
The historical `LEGACY_SIGNAL` parity hash this clause originally
guarded was retired with the per-tick legacy path in Workstream D.2;
the same isolation guarantees now apply to the SIGNAL-only fast-path.
Mechanism-binding enforcement (Gate G16) and active aggregation of
`HorizonFeature` implementations land in Phase 3.

### Phase-3-α status (SIGNAL layer live)

As of Phase 3-α, the `SIGNAL` layer is fully live and is the canonical
Layer-2 contract:

- `layer: SIGNAL` alphas are loaded by `AlphaLoader._load_signal_layer`
  and registered as `LoadedSignalLayerModule`. Their `evaluate` does
  not participate in `CompositeSignalEngine`; they are driven by the
  new `HorizonSignalEngine` instead.
- `HorizonSignalEngine` subscribes to `HorizonFeatureSnapshot`,
  `RegimeState`, and `SensorReading`, applies the alpha's compiled
  `regime_gate`, and emits `Signal(layer="SIGNAL", regime_gate_state,
  horizon_seconds, consumed_features, ...)` via a dedicated
  `_signal_seq` `SequenceGenerator` (Inv-A / C1 isolation).
- Every `SIGNAL`-layer alpha must declare `horizon_seconds`,
  `depends_on_sensors`, `regime_gate.on_condition` /
  `off_condition`, `cost_arithmetic`, and a `signal: |` block whose
  `evaluate(snapshot, regime, params)` is parsed and validated by
  gates G2–G13 at load time.
- The reference alpha
  [`alphas/pofi_benign_midcap_v1`](pofi_benign_midcap_v1/) ships as
  the canonical Phase-3 example. Its Level-2 SIGNAL parity hash is
  locked in `tests/determinism/test_signal_replay.py`. Drift in
  ordering, scope, or sequence allocation surfaces as a baseline
  failure on the next CI run.
- `scripts/run_backtest.py --emit-signals-jsonl` dumps every emitted
  `Signal` to stdout under prefix `SIGNAL_JSONL`; post-D.2 every row
  carries `layer="SIGNAL"`.
- Gates G2, G4–G8, G12, G13 are **active** — see the Architectural
  gates table above. Gate G16 (mechanism-horizon binding) remains
  scaffolded; it flips active in Phase 3.1 alongside the v0.3
  reference alphas.

### Phase-3.1 status (mechanism-horizon binding ACTIVE)

As of Phase 3.1, the v0.3 mechanism-horizon contract is enforced and
four reference alphas exercise the four non-stress families:

- **Gate G16 is ACTIVE** for any `schema_version: "1.1"`
  `SIGNAL`/`PORTFOLIO` spec that declares a `trend_mechanism:` block.
  See the Architectural gates table for the nine binding rules. v0.2
  `SIGNAL` specs without a `trend_mechanism:` block continue to load
  (G16 is opt-in via field presence, unless strict mode is enabled).
  The historical `LEGACY_SIGNAL`-exempt branch is moot post-D.2: the
  loader rejects `LEGACY_SIGNAL` before any gate runs.
- **Strict mode (`platform.yaml: enforce_trend_mechanism: true`,
  default `false`)** additionally rejects any schema-1.1
  `SIGNAL`/`PORTFOLIO` spec *missing* a `trend_mechanism:` block. This
  is the recommended setting once an operator has committed to the
  v0.3 mechanism contract; it catches "drift back to v0.2" at load
  time rather than at promotion review.
- **Reference alphas (one per non-stress family):**
  - [`alphas/pofi_hawkes_burst_v1`](pofi_hawkes_burst_v1/) —
    `HAWKES_SELF_EXCITE`, 30 s horizon, hazard-exit enabled.
  - [`alphas/pofi_kyle_drift_v1`](pofi_kyle_drift_v1/) — `KYLE_INFO`,
    300 s horizon, slow drift on informed-trader price impact.
  - [`alphas/pofi_inventory_revert_v1`](pofi_inventory_revert_v1/) —
    `INVENTORY`, 30 s horizon, contrarian on quote-replenish
    asymmetry (`abs(zscore) > 2.0`).
  - [`alphas/pofi_moc_imbalance_v1`](pofi_moc_imbalance_v1/) —
    `SCHEDULED_FLOW`, 120 s horizon, MOC-window flow tracking via the
    tuple-valued `scheduled_flow_window` sensor (component-expanded
    by `HorizonSignalEngine`).
- **`LIQUIDITY_STRESS` is enforced exit-only.** Gate G16 rule 7
  AST-scans every stress-family alpha's `signal:` body and rejects
  any code path that can return a `LONG`/`SHORT` `Signal`. Stress
  alphas may only emit `FLAT` (close-position) signals.
- **`Signal` event metadata is propagated end-to-end.** Every
  `Signal` emitted by `HorizonSignalEngine` carries
  `Signal.trend_mechanism: TrendMechanism | None` and
  `Signal.expected_half_life_seconds: int` so post-trade forensics,
  regime-overlay attribution, and crowding diagnostics can group
  realized PnL by mechanism family without re-parsing alpha YAML at
  attribution time.
- **`RegimeHazardSpike` events** are emitted by
  `RegimeHazardDetector` (wired behind the alpha-level
  `hazard_exit.enabled: true` flag, default off) when a regime
  posterior shows a significant departure episode. Suppression is
  per `(symbol, engine_name, departing_state)` transition — at most
  one spike per departure; re-arms only when a different state
  becomes dominant or the departing posterior recovers above the
  `1.0 − hysteresis_threshold` floor.
- **Tuple-valued sensors** (currently `scheduled_flow_window`) are
  fanned out into per-component scalar entries in the
  `HorizonSignalEngine` sensor cache via an explicit static mapping
  (`_TUPLE_SENSOR_COMPONENTS`), so the scalar-only `RegimeGate` DSL
  can reference `scheduled_flow_window_active`,
  `seconds_to_window_close`, etc. directly.
- `scripts/run_backtest.py --emit-hazard-spikes-jsonl` dumps every
  emitted `RegimeHazardSpike` to stdout under prefix `HAZARD_JSONL`,
  composable with the prior `--emit-{sensor-readings,horizon-ticks,
  snapshots,signals}-jsonl` flags. The Level-5 hazard parity hash
  baseline lives in `tests/determinism/test_regime_hazard_replay.py`.

### Phase-4 status (PORTFOLIO layer live)

As of Phase 4, the `PORTFOLIO` layer is fully live and runs
side-by-side with `SIGNAL` alphas on the same universe:

- `layer: PORTFOLIO` alphas are loaded by
  `AlphaLoader._load_portfolio_layer` and registered as
  `LoadedPortfolioLayerModule`. Their `evaluate(context, params) →
  SizedPositionIntent` is driven by `CompositionEngine`, never by
  `CompositeSignalEngine` or `HorizonSignalEngine`.
- `UniverseSynchronizer` subscribes to `Signal` events emitted by
  the upstream `depends_on_signals` alphas, fans them in per
  `(alpha_id, horizon_seconds, boundary_index)`, and emits a
  `CrossSectionalContext` event once the boundary closes (or once
  the per-platform fan-in deadline elapses, whichever comes first).
  The context carries `completeness` (the fraction of the alpha's
  declared `universe` that supplied a non-stale signal); contexts
  below `composition_completeness_threshold` (default `0.7` in
  `platform.yaml`) are dropped silently — see G9 in the
  Architectural gates table.
- `CompositionEngine` consumes the context, runs the alpha's
  `evaluate`, and routes the result through `FactorNeutralizer →
  SectorMatcher → CrossSectionalRanker → TurnoverOptimizer` (in
  that fixed order) before emitting the `SizedPositionIntent`.
  Every component is deterministic by construction and contributes
  to the intent's `decision_basis_hash`. The Level-3 SIZED-INTENT
  parity hash is locked in
  `tests/determinism/test_sized_intent_replay.py`; drift in
  ordering, scope, weights, or sequence allocation surfaces as a
  baseline failure on the next CI run.
- The risk engine consumes `SizedPositionIntent` via
  `RiskEngine.check_sized_intent`, which decomposes the desired
  book delta against `PositionStore` (current quantity + most
  recent mark price) and emits per-leg `OrderRequest`s sorted
  lexicographically by symbol. **Per-leg veto** (Inv-11) is
  enforced: a single leg failing risk checks drops only that leg,
  never the entire intent. Each emitted `OrderRequest.reason =
  "PORTFOLIO"` for lineage tracking. The Level-4 PORTFOLIO
  ORDER-REQUEST parity hash is locked in
  `tests/determinism/test_portfolio_order_replay.py`.
- Every PORTFOLIO alpha must declare `universe`,
  `depends_on_signals`, `factor_neutralization`, and
  `cost_arithmetic`. Risk-budget keys (`max_position_per_symbol`,
  `max_gross_exposure_pct`, `capital_allocation_pct`) are
  inherited by per-leg `OrderRequest`s through the standard risk
  pipeline. Reference factor loadings live under
  `data/reference/factor_loadings/<universe_hash>/loadings.json`
  (with optional `loadings.parquet`) and a sector map under
  `data/reference/sector_map/sector_map.json`; both are produced
  by `scripts/build_reference_factor_loadings.py` and folded into
  the bootstrap provenance bundle (Inv-13).
- Bootstrap is gated on `AlphaRegistry.has_portfolio_alphas()` —
  if no PORTFOLIO alpha is registered, no composition components
  are constructed and the orchestrator runs a strict superset of
  the Phase-3-α pipeline. When PORTFOLIO alphas *are* registered,
  bootstrap also instantiates `CrossSectionalTracker` (per-strategy
  gross/net/factor/mechanism aggregation), `HorizonMetricsCollector`
  (12 composition + hazard metrics), and (if any alpha enables
  `hazard_exit.enabled: true`) `HazardExitController`.
- The reference alpha
  [`alphas/pofi_xsect_v1`](pofi_xsect_v1/) ships as the canonical
  Phase-4 example, with a sibling `pofi_xsect_v1.with_decay.alpha.yaml`
  exercising the Phase-4.1 decay-weighting branch and
  [`alphas/pofi_xsect_mixed_mechanism_v1`](pofi_xsect_mixed_mechanism_v1/)
  exercising the multi-mechanism cap.
- `scripts/run_backtest.py` exposes three new emission flags
  composable with the Phase-3 ones:
  - `--emit-cross-sectional-jsonl` (prefix `XSECT_JSONL`),
  - `--emit-sized-intents-jsonl` (prefix `SIZED_JSONL`),
  - `--emit-hazard-exits-jsonl` (prefix `HAZARD_EXIT_JSONL`).
- Gates G1, G3, G9, G10, G11 are **active** — see the
  Architectural gates table above. G1 / G3 are downgradable to
  warnings via `PlatformConfig.enforce_layer_gates: false` for
  research workflows; G9 / G10 / G11 always block.

### Phase-4.1 status (decay weighting + hazard exit ACTIVE)

As of Phase 4.1, two opt-in extensions to the Phase-4 baseline are
live:

- **Decay weighting (`CrossSectionalRanker`).** A PORTFOLIO alpha
  with `parameters.decay_weighting_enabled.default: true`
  multiplies each per-symbol raw alpha score by `exp(-Δt / hl)`
  before standardization, where `Δt = boundary_ts_ns -
  signal.timestamp_ns` and `hl = signal.expected_half_life_seconds
  * 1e9` (per-mechanism half-life from G16). Clamped below by
  `decay_floor` (default `1e-6`). Decay weighting is *additive* —
  the structural ranking semantics are unchanged — and produces a
  different `decision_basis_hash` than the decay-OFF baseline,
  verified by the cross-check in
  `tests/determinism/test_sized_intent_with_decay_replay.py`. The
  performance budget is **≤5% wall-clock end-to-end regression**
  vs the same alpha with decay OFF
  (`tests/perf/test_phase4_1_no_regression.py`).
- **Hazard exit (`HazardExitController`).** A PORTFOLIO alpha
  with `hazard_exit.enabled: true` participates in two exit paths:
  - On `RegimeHazardSpike`: if the spike's hazard score exceeds
    `hazard_score_threshold` (per-alpha) AND the position has
    been open at least `min_age_seconds`, emit an `OrderRequest`
    with `reason = "HAZARD_SPIKE"` flattening the position.
    Suppression is per `(symbol, alpha_id, departing_state)`.
  - On `Trade` reconciliation: if the position has been open
    longer than `hard_exit_age_seconds`, emit an `OrderRequest`
    with `reason = "HARD_EXIT_AGE"` (hard cap, fired regardless
    of regime). Suppressed for `hard_exit_suppression_seconds`
    after firing.
  Both paths are bit-identical across replays (Inv-5) — verified
  by `tests/determinism/test_hazard_exit_replay.py`.
- **Mechanism breakdown + cap (`CrossSectionalRanker`).** Every
  `SizedPositionIntent` carries a `mechanism_breakdown:
  dict[TrendMechanism, float]` reporting the gross-exposure share
  per upstream mechanism family. The PORTFOLIO alpha's
  `trend_mechanism.consumes:` list declares per-family
  `max_share_of_gross` caps; the ranker scales any over-budget
  family down proportionally before re-normalizing the gross.
  G16 PORTFOLIO rule 8 enforces the cap summation at load time;
  the ranker enforces it at emission time. Verified by
  `tests/integration/test_mixed_mechanism_universe.py`.

### Backward compatibility

- Schema 1.0 specs are rejected (Workstream D.1 hard-removal).
- Schema-1.1 specs declaring `layer: LEGACY_SIGNAL` are rejected
  (Workstream D.2 retirement); the rejection error includes a
  pointer to the migration cookbook.
- A schema-1.1 spec without `layer:` is rejected — there is no
  implicit upgrade path (§8.7).

### Migration

The dedicated migration guide ships at
[`docs/migration/schema_1_0_to_1_1.md`](../docs/migration/schema_1_0_to_1_1.md).
After Workstream D.2 the only accepted layer values are `SIGNAL` and
`PORTFOLIO`; the previously documented mechanical
``layer: LEGACY_SIGNAL`` upgrade is no longer accepted by the loader.
Authors must promote per-tick alphas to the SIGNAL layer (declaring
`horizon_seconds`, `depends_on_sensors`, `regime_gate`,
`cost_arithmetic`, and a 3-arg `evaluate(snapshot, regime, params)`
signal block) — the cookbook walks through this end-to-end.

**Workstream-D notes —** the in-repo LEGACY parity test
(`tests/determinism/test_legacy_alpha_parity.py`) and its anchoring
reference alpha (`alphas/trade_cluster_drift/`) were retired in D.2.
Both the per-tick legacy execution path and the loader-side
`LEGACY_SIGNAL` dispatch were removed in the same workstream; the
Level-1 LEGACY-fill parity hash is no longer maintained in this repo.

### Phase-5 status (documentation + LEGACY_SIGNAL retirement complete)

As of Phase 5 + Workstream D.2, the platform's externally facing
documentation is synchronised with the three-layer architecture and
the LEGACY_SIGNAL retirement is complete:

- **Migration cookbook live** at
  [`docs/migration/schema_1_0_to_1_1.md`](../docs/migration/schema_1_0_to_1_1.md)
  — covers the schema 1.0 → 1.1 upgrade, the per-tick → SIGNAL
  promotion path, the `regime_gate` DSL, the `cost_arithmetic` block,
  authoring a PORTFOLIO alpha, hazard exits, and the v0.3
  `trend_mechanism` opt-in cookbook.
- **Layer-specific templates** ship under
  [`alphas/_template/`](_template/): `template_signal.alpha.yaml` and
  `template_portfolio.alpha.yaml`.  The original
  `template.alpha.yaml` (schema 1.0) was deleted in workstream D.1
  and `template_legacy_signal.alpha.yaml` was deleted in D.2 with
  the loader-side retirement.  No in-repo per-tick LEGACY template
  will be re-introduced.
- **Hypothesis Reasoning Protocol** lives at
  [`grok/prompts/hypothesis_reasoning.md`](../grok/prompts/hypothesis_reasoning.md)
  with companion files
  [`grok/prompts/sensor_catalog.md`](../grok/prompts/sensor_catalog.md)
  and
  [`grok/prompts/mutation_protocol.md`](../grok/prompts/mutation_protocol.md).
  The earlier draft `grok/07_HYPOTHESIS_REASONING_PLAN.md` is marked
  SUPERSEDED.
- **`LEGACY_SIGNAL` is hard-rejected.** The loader's once-per-process
  sunset banner has been removed; any spec carrying
  `layer: LEGACY_SIGNAL` raises an `AlphaLoadError` at parse time
  with a stable pointer to the migration cookbook.
